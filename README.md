## what is this?

a LED display from the 1980s (the copyright on the PCB says 1985), 96 pixels wide by 38 pixels high

this repo is the software running on a connected raspberry pi which runs "shows" i.e. renders text, p5 scripts, (soon) shaders and shows them on the display

it (this repo/code) also presents a web UI so that people can add/edit shows. that is mostly a work in progress.

huge thanks to [Antoine Leclair](https://github.com/antoineleclair/) for his help in architecturing and all things async!
